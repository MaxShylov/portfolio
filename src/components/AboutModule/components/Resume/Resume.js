        As a middle software developer with 3 years in the web development field, my current career goal is to
        collaborate in building complex web applications. With a solid technical background, a keen eye for the detail
        and a self-motivated and a user-centered attitude, I switch easily from Front-End development to Back-End
        architecture.
